# ReactNative Components
1. **View** (exactly what div does, the only difference is you cannot add text inside it, it needs to be wrapped in Text Component)
2. **Text** (exactly what p tag does, additionally it supports props like onPress, allowFontScale, etc...)
3. **TouchableOpacity** (if you want to make any area clickable you wrap with TouchableOpacity, it brings down the opacity of that area)
4. **FlatList** (you can optimise your list using this.)
5. **Image** (it helps to show the image either remote or local)
